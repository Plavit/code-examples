Collection of Example Programs
==============================

This catalogue spans an assortment of programming languages, including sample code, demos, and tutorial programs.

Programming Languages
---------------------

All code examples are in a folder corresponding to the programming language.

-  [C](/C/)
-  [D3](/D3/)
-  [Java](/Java/)
-  [LaTeX](/LaTeX/)
-  [OpenGL](/OpenGL/)

Purpose of the Examples
-----------------------

The goal of this catalogue is to provide a set of examples of how to implement and write code in a variety of languages. Think of it as inspiration, showcasing  how to run certain algorithms or complete certain objectives. They can serve as snippets of code for a programmer to refresh on how to use parts of a language or how best to structure their code given a language's features.

Adding Code Examples
--------------------

Additional examples may be added to this repository over time.

But if you have anything you would like to add, feel free to either make an issue or fork and send a pull request! Credit will be given. :smiley:
