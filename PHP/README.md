Compiling & Running Code
------------------------

Set up a PHP server to serve the code, possibly a database too.

For Linux, check on how to set up a LAMP server for your distribution.

For Windows, WAMP is a simple solution.

For Mac, there is a web server built in, but MAMP is another solid option.
